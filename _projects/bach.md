title: J.S. Bach, Unaccompanied Suites for Solo Cello, Suite V, I. Prelude
description: This project is a culmination of my studies in cello performance over the past year. While most of my year was spent working on Brahms' Sonata for Cello and Piano in F Major, school closure and the resulting inability to work with a pianist anymore forced me to choose a solo piece that I could learn in a month.

The Bach Suites for Unaccompanied are often recognized as the most prolific set piece for
cello, with even the most skilled cellists calling them the Mt. Everest of cello playing. Apart from
a substantial piece of repertoire for the cello, the Suites continue to catch the attention of all
musicians, classical or otherwise, for their use of endless hidden harmonies. Many
contemporary solo cello pieces also take harmonic queues from the Suites. These underlying
harmonies drive each of the six movements of each of the six suites and are the reason why
many cellists and musicians often refer to the piece as Self-Accompanied Suites.

Each of the suites’ latter 5 movements are all in dance form, and are preceded by a movement
called a Prelude, or an introduction to the suite that establishes the key and provides both the
cellist and listener with a groundwork to listen to the rest of the suite.

While the Preludes stand alone within the framework of the Suites, the Prelude to the 5th Suite
manages to separate itself from the other 5 Preludes in almost every way. Firstly, the entire fifth
Suite is written for a cello where the uppermost string is tuned down a whole tone. A technique
called scordatura, simply meaning detuning, it completely changes the instrument’s tone quality
(especially on that string) and because of that string’s looser tension on the instrument, it allows
the cello to resonate differently than it normally does. This Prelude is also written in two distinct
sections: an introduction and a fugue. The introduction is more free-form and contains broad
chords which act as a demonstration of what effects the scordatura tuning has on the
instrument. The second half is in fugue form, and is much more rhythmic than the introduction. It
is in this section where Bach’s work of incorporating intricate harmonies into his composition
shines the brightest. Moments of deceptive resolutions and recalls to the main motif of the fugue
take the listener on a journey where they feel as though they are being taken home and almost
instantaneously transported to another setting over and over again.

My journey with this piece hasn’t been the most orthodox and the context in which I explored
this piece most certainly allowed me to appreciate it on a completely different level. I started
learning this piece at the beginning of April, in Morgantown, WV. I spent the past year learning
Brahms Cello Sonata in F Major, but without access to a pianist, my plans had to drastically
change. I have never had any reason to go to Morgantown, but the closing of our school due to
COVID-19 forced my good friends and I to make a choice: spend the rest of our college
experience in our homes, not knowing when we would see each other again, or move to
Morgantown, where the family of one of our friends generously offered us to stay with each
other on property they owned. While we knew where we were going and how long we would
stay, the feeling of uncertainty around every other aspect of our lives was at the forefront of our
minds. We were suddenly trying to balance schoolwork (now online), meals, managing and
maintaining our living space, limiting our exposure to the outside world, and most importantly,
our mental health. While this experience has both allowed me to appreciate the bonds I share
with people with whom I have experienced the past three and a half years of my life with, it has
left me feeling a bit homesick at the same time. Learning this piece in this context of my life has
allowed me to bring myself home in all aspects except the physical sense and calm much of the
uncertainty that this experience has brought on. Both cello and the Suites have been a pivotal
part of my life ever since I started playing as a 5 year old. The two sections of this Prelude, the
freeform and the more structured, allow me to reflect on times of freedom and structure in my
life. While my academic life at school was more structured, I had more freedom with my time
outside of academics. At this point in my life, my academic life is less structured, with many of
my projects being self directed, but my life outside is much less limited.
