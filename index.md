AHS Capstone provides Olin students the opportunity to dive deep in their AHS (Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences) concentration and create an original, independent project with guidance and input from content-expert mentors. Each year, the AHS Capstone class has a tradition of sharing our work with the Olin community in a live, interactive exhibit—inspiring current conversations and future AHS work and play. During this time of social distancing, we believe AHS can uplift, inspire, and connect us more than ever—so we offer to you “AHS Capstone Online."
