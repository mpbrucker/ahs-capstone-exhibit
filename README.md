# AHS Capstone Online

At Olin College, the AHS (Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences) Capstone class is the culmination of students' AHS engagement. AHS Capstone provides Olin students the opportunity to dive deep in their 12-credit AHS concentration and create an original, independent project with guidance and input from content-expert mentors. Each year, the AHS Capstone class has a tradition of sharing our work with the Olin community in a live, interactive exhibitâ€”inspiring current conversations and future AHS work and play.

Because of the shift to online classes for the second half of the Spring 2020 semester, we created an online showcase to allow students to show off their work. This static website provides links to students' projects as well as a "VR exhibit," modeled after the Olin College library, for you to explore their work as well.
